<h1 style='text-align: center;'>SATOSHICASH</h1>
<h3 style='text-align: center;'>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>SatoshiCash token is the first meme token inspired by great Satoshi Nakamoto developed on Core Blockchain 
by a group of “fair crypto” enthusiasts. Inspired by the ultimate sound currency model, Bitcoin of Satoshi 
Nakamoto, the crypto industry had speedy evolution over the past decade with much emphasis on scalability and 
security. First Bitcoin, then comes Ethereum, and now Core. The recent boom in DeFi in the core ecosystem 
reaffirms the fact that the blockchain industry is still very young with endless possibilities. SatoshiCash is 
built with a protocol of fairness that creates intrinsic value.</p> 
<br>
<h3 style='text-align: center;'>PROBLEM</h3>
<p>Almost uncountable L2s launch on daily basis, with 99.9% of the tokens focused mainly on quick gains which 
often results in massive pumps only to be dumped over night by early investors. The larger population in core 
ecosystem is made up of crypto newbies who, more often than not, FOMO in and get stuck forever. On the other hand, 
we see very innovative L2s with good token models but are inaccessible to everyday people. Most users can not 
afford to participate in the token governance and economics. This barrier isolates everyday people from exploring 
myriad opportunities.</p>
<br>
<h3 style='text-align: center;'>SOLUTION</h3>
<p>SatoshiCash implements an outstanding ‘deflationary’ model and ‘secure’ token ethics. The smart contract is open 
sourced and verified for averyone to conduct their own research Liquidity and team tokens locked. Thus, we have 
achieved a fair crypto token which increases the value of each STC token by every transaction made. A 4% transaction 
fee is deducted from every transaction as follows: 3% burnt forever, 1% sent to a marketing wallet for marketing purposes. 
With core chain’s extreme low fees, secure and scalable blockchain technology, SatoshiCash brings DeFi at the 
finger-tips of everyday people with endless opportunities.</p>
<br>
<h3 style='text-align: center;'>TOKENOMICS</h3>
<p>The token supply is capped at 10,000,000,000,000 STC. The team allocation is 10% (1,000,000,000,000 STC) Locked and vested over one year. 
  30% (3,000,000,000,000 STC) is allocated for private sale locked and vested over one year. 20% (2,000,000,000,000 STC) liquidity and 
  10% (1,000,000,000,000 STC) for marketing purposes. 30% (3,000,000,000,000) is burnt to initiate the weekly burn event.</p>
<br>
<h3 style='text-align: center;'>TEAM</h3>
<p>SatoshiCash is developed by decentralized, anonymous team who work together ensuring trust in the code. SatoshiCash is a 
permission-less and trustless protocol with very minimal admin control and functions. No need for any centralized 
control. The team is only necessary to pursue community engagements, marketing and future project developments.</p>
<br>
<h3 style='text-align: center;'>DISCLAIMER</h3>
<p>SatoshiCash token is developed for crypto enthusiasts to explore the opportunities in DeFi. By interacting 
with the token, you agree that you have fully understood how the token operates. This is not a guarantee of any
